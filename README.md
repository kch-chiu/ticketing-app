# ticketing-app     ** WORK IN PROGRESS **

This application is a website built upon a microservices architecture that allows business owners to sell tickets online based on the name and price. 
Then other users who log in can purchase tickets posted online using a credit card.

This is a rough draft of the application but many changes and improvements are on the way.


# Tech Stack

Front end service is built with NextJS (ReactJS) and backend services are built with NodeJS and Typescript. Basic tests are written in Jest.

GitHub Actions have been created to help deploy the microservices app to Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS).



# Acknowledgements

This application is built upon the Udemy course "Microservices with NodeJS and React" by Stephen Grider with many infrastructure changes including code refactoring and support for managing TLS certificates.

Thanks to Stephen for the initial implementation that inspired a lot of additional work on this microservices app!
